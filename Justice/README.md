Justice
=======

The Justice system in the UK is disproportionately applied in many 
cases, and many judicial mechanisms are hidden from public scrutiny. We 
are committed to creating a transparent, reasonable and fair justice 
system for all. 

There should be no more secret courts. All judicial process should be 
fair, open and accountable, Justice must be seen to be done. The police 
must be transparent and accountable; we would ensure independent 
oversight of all investigations into police wrongdoing - police 
internal investigations should run their full course even if an officer 
under investigation resigns or retires. We will insist that searches of 
personal property should only be done with reasonable suspicion of a 
serious criminal offence.

Judicial review of all other officials should be protected; it is 
essential that courts prevent officials from acting outside of their 
legal powers. We would remove restrictions on who can ask for a judicial 
review, and give High Court judges the discretion to conduct reviews 
without interference.

Alcohol and drug abuse or dependency should no longer be treated as 
criminal issues; people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction need 
help, not punishment. Contaminated drugs can kill; people should be able 
to submit dangerous or contaminated drugs to officials, without fear of 
being prosecuted. Safe locations should be provided for heroin addicts 
to inject, with sterile equipment and under medical supervision.

The poor are served disproportionately by the justice system. Legal 
representation must be available to all; it should not be a privilege 
for those who can afford it. We would reverse cuts to Legal Aid and 
introduce reforms to guarantee access to legal representation for all. 
Sanctions would discourage frivolous motions.

Fines issued to convicted criminals should be proportionate to the 
person's wealth, in order to penalise people equally. We would introduce 
a system of "Day Fines", where punishments are assessed based on annual 
income; fines are then scaled accordingly, to punish people equally. 
This would also apply to commercial fines, which would scale fairly for 
both large multinational and small businesses.

Imprisonment should be a last resort, and should be a process of 
rehabilitation, rather than punishment. Removing prisoners' vote 
violates their human rights. Voting is an essential part of society; by 
allowing prisoners to meaningfully participate in society, we can 
rehabilitate them back into it. Prisoners would be permitted to vote in 
the constituency they were registered in prior to incarceration.
