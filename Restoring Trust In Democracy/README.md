Restoring Trust In Democracy
============================

Our democracy is in real danger. All too few people take part and vote, 
not enough people are able or willing to get involved. It's time to 
reverse that trend, and it starts with restoring trust in government and 
the political system.

The independence referendum in Scotland showed that when people believe 
they can make a difference they get involved with the process. We need 
to replicate that across the UK.

**We can start by trusting people.**

Given that self determination is one of the Party's fundamental 
principles, we believe that a referendum on the UK's membership of the 
EU should be offered to voters in the UK. We trust people to make the 
right decision.

We want to open up our democracy to younger people. They see their lives 
and futures directed by governments they have no say over. We trust 
young people and want to allow them to vote from the age of 16.

The government also needs to be more open and accountable.

We will introduce a new right for constituents to force a by-election in 
the event of a loss of confidence in their MP.

We will require minutes of all meetings of officials on government 
business to be accessible through Freedom of Information requests. We 
will also aim to ensure that all available information that could be 
requested under a Freedom of Information request is made public by 
default.

The quality of legislation must be improved, and we have to aim to avoid 
laws that don't do what they were claimed to do.  We would investigate 
the possibility of permanent elected legislative committees for each 
government department in the Commons rather than ad hoc public bill 
committees. We would roll out post-legislative scrutiny on all important 
policy-changing acts before new bills on the same subject are to be 
considered.

We will require that all international treaties be passed through the UK 
parliament as a standard bill, requiring the full approval of both
houses. The detail of the government's deals and agreements with 
suppliers and other businesses should be disclosed. 

Independent audits of public sector spending and processes should be 
carried out annually, with bi-annual review of spending to identify 
where spending reductions or greater returns are possible without 
reducing the overall effectiveness of the public sector.  

The delivery of services to government is littered with stories of 
companies exceeding budgets, delivering late and renegotiating contracts 
to improve profits. This seriously undermines public confidence in a 
government's ability to negotiate sensible contracts.

 We will implement penalties for significant performance failures for 
 government suppliers. If a company fails to deliver a government 
 project within 125% of budget or 125% of the deadline then that 
 company (both its parent organisations and subsidiaries) would be 
 banned from providing services or products to the government for at 
 least 2 years.

Beyond government, we need to improve our democracy. We see proportional 
representation as vital to ensuring that governments properly represent 
everyone, and that everyone's voice matters in elections. We intend to 
restart the national debate and push for a system of proportional 
representation to be implemented for all elections in the UK.
