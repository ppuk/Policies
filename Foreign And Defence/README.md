Foreign And Defence
===================

Defence of the realm is a primary responsibility of government. The
United Kingdom must be able to meet its own defence needs as well as its
obligations to defend overseas territories and allies. Whilst we are not
in favour of so-called 'pre-emptive defence' or an aggressive defence
posture, we realise that the UK must be ready to respond to aggression
or threats to our way of life. We firmly believe that our Armed Forces
must be well equipped with the appropriate equipment for the tasks we
ask them to undertake, and trained for the roles in which they find
themselves.

As part of moving towards the aim of a nuclear free Europe we would
remove the nuclear weapons capability of the UK. We do not see that it
any longer has a place in the current post-cold war environment.

We must ensure that we take care of our Armed Forces to the best of our
ability and use them only when absolutely necessary. All members of the
Armed Forces should be secure in the knowledge that the country will not
desert them once they complete their terms of service.
