Digital Rights And Surveillance
===============================

Ever since the Pirate Party was founded we have been pointing out that 
the new world of technology brings new challenges and opportunities to 
politics. The Internet deserves a voice in parliament, as all too often 
our representatives have been wilfully ignorant. This is why we stand 
for digital rights. This is about protecting our rights and making sure 
that the digital revolution is available to all, and not just a few.

**For many, the online world is a place to reclaim some freedom. Here 
too, we are increasingly watched and restricted. We're here to say it 
doesn't have to be like that.**

A citizen's right to private communication is vital. We will forbid third 
parties from intercepting or monitoring communication traffic, and 
require specific warrants to be issued by a court before communications 
traffic is monitored. We will oppose the return of the Communications 
Data Bill (“Snoopers' Charter”) as well as the addition of similar legislation 
to any other bill. We will ensure that the freedom to encrypt data and 
communications is not abridged or limited, and that access to encryption 
tools is not restricted.

The Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee must be truly 
independent and robust; it must act for UK citizens, not protect vested 
interests.

We will strengthen data protection laws: companies must inform data 
subjects of their rights and be clear about their data policies.

We will make it easier to apply to a court for compensation where data 
protection laws have been breached, and increase the penalties for any 
breaches of data protection laws. We will allow the courts to apply 
these penalties to both the individuals and companies responsible, 
proportional to the scale of the breach.

We want clearer guidelines and restrictions on the use of DNA records by 
authorities. This will ensure samples are only taken voluntarily or when 
there are reasonable grounds to suspect the individual of having 
committed a serious offence. Samples should be promptly destroyed if the 
individual is acquitted or not charged with a criminal offence, and they 
should only be held for the length of time for which there is a 
reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed a crime.

Too often the outgoing government's digital policy has been directed by 
tabloid headlines, not experts in the field. We will stop the government 
imposition of blanket censorship tools such as so-called "web filtering" or 
site blocking. We will disband the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit 
(PIPCU). We will repeal the sections of the Digital Economy Act which conflict 
with digital rights.

Everyone should have an equal right to access the benefits that technology 
can bring. We will extend the requirement to provide basic telephone 
services to a requirement to provide a minimum level of broadband 
service and extend this responsibility to all providers who operate in 
the UK.

We know that the UK's future success depends on a modern broadband 
infrastructure  supporting a free and open Internet. We must aim to end 
the "Digital Divide". We will promote the provision of free public WiFi 
as well as the provision of Internet access to community centres and 
libraries by local authorities.

It is vital no-one is excluded from the digital revolution. We will 
promote the inclusion of accessibility features, such as subtitles and 
audio descriptions for the disabled. Our aim is to make content 
accessible for disabled people. We will introduce an obligation for 
publishers to provide a DRM-free copy of their product where necessary 
to facilitate the use of accessibility programs (for example, voice 
synthesiser software to "read out" an e-book to a visually impaired 
person).
