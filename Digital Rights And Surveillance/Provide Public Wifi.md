Provide Public Wifi
===================

We will promote the provision of free public WiFi as well as the 
provision of Internet access in community centres and libraries by 
local authorities. At present a significant portion of us have limited 
access to the Internet and the benefits that access provides. Providing 
access where it is otherwise limited is a good initial step to reducing 
and eventually ending the digital divide.
