Welfare And Work
================

All UK citizens should be able to rely on the welfare system as a safety 
net. We believe the current system is failing and needs to be 
revitalised. A successful welfare system reaches everyone in need. 
Punitive measures on those who try to exploit the system hurt the needy. 
We would introduce measures to prevent people receiving unfair blocks on 
benefits. 

We would remove the benefit cap: either someone is eligible for benefit, 
or they are not. All criteria for eligibility should be considered 
independently of each other. 

People under 25 receive a lower level of Job Seekers Allowance, and 
people under 35 receive a lower level of housing benefit than older 
people. We would end age discrimination in the benefits system; 
everyone who is no longer in full-time education and who has not yet 
reached retirement age should receive equal benefits.

The "Bedroom Tax" (a reduction in housing benefit for a house considered 
to be under-occupied) puts extraordinary pressure on new benefits 
claimants to give up established homes, at a time when they are at their 
most vulnerable; it has caused disruption to both landlords and tenants 
alike. We would revoke the "Bedroom Tax", and restore full housing 
benefit to those in need.

"Workfare" forces people on benefits to do unpaid work for private 
businesses, or face sanctions; this system has resulted in private 
employers exploiting free labour. We would replace Workfare with 
employment in a government-backed enterprise scheme. This would allow 
people to earn money, gain training and acquire experience without being 
exploited by private companies for profit.

We recognise that many people who are starting or returning to 
employment are also being exploited for free labour. Internships are 
typically full-time jobs, yet interns often go unpaid. We would ensure 
that providers of internships are required to pay the National Minimum 
Wage.

The National Minimum Wage (NMW) itself is severely lacking; a full-time 
job at NMW does not meet the basic cost of living in the UK. People in 
work should not suffer poverty; we would raise the minimum wage to match 
the Living Wage Foundation's recommendation, and keep NMW in line with 
the basic cost of living in the UK. 

Trade unions provide a way for workers' interests to be represented and 
defended. Trade union powers, including workers' right to strike to 
protest unfair work conditions, have been eroded under the coalition 
government. We would restore the power of trade unions, by reducing the 
strike notice period to 7 days, and revoking the 50% turnout requirement 
for a strike vote.

Work should not prevent people from starting a family; the UK 
government's Shared Parental Leave program starts in April this year, 
and makes leave fairer. However, it does not take into account some 
situations that may affect families - including families with three or 
more parents (e.g. via parental responsibility agreements). We would 
extend this system to include all parents in a family.
