Fair Tax Brackets
=================

There are continuous debates about the specifics of tax brackets as well 
as arguments around when they should be increased or lowered. We will 
propose a scheme whereby income tax brackets and personal allowances are 
calculated as multiples or fractions of the median income and float with 
the economy. As the economy improves, more people on low incomes would 
be removed from the tax system; if the economy deteriorates taxes 
increase for all, but with a smaller impact at the bottom of the income 
scale. Individuals earning less than half of the national median income 
will not pay income taxes.
