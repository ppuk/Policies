Adopt The Space For Cycling Framework
=====================================

We would adopt the "Making Space for Cycling" framework.  

* Cycle infrastructure funding to councils would be increased to £20 
    per person 
 
* Safeguards would ensure that it is spent on infrastructure that 
    primarily benefits cyclists
    
The key to enabling high cycling levels is excellent quality 
infrastructure, appropriate to the location, as well as bicycle parking.
People don't like mixing with heavy traffic. Space for cycling is 
needed, away from motor vehicles, with care taken in relation to 
pedestrians. For instance, mixing cycles with pedestrians on narrow 
footways is never acceptable. In new developments providing for cycling 
will free up space that can be used for more productive things, such as 
houses, shops, or public space. The ease of cycling, and the casual 
interaction that this brings, makes it easy for people to visit shops 
and chat with friends, fostering the sense of community which is an 
essential element in a successful new development.

New developments and street renewals should design for a third of all 
journeys to be made by bike. This is achievable if the right design 
approach is applied.
