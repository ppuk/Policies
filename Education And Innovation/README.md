Education And Innovation
========================

### Education

We need an education system which delivers a great education to everyone 
and makes it possible for people of any age to reach their full 
potential. It means investing in early years, primary and secondary 
education and removing barriers to higher education by scrapping tuition 
fees.

The framework for early years education must be updated to ensure it 
meets the needs of children before they get to school. We also need to 
ensure that early years teachers have time to teach, by reducing the 
administrative burden where possible. 

Parents in some areas are facing a shortage of school places, 
particularly in primary schools, where they  are seeing increased class 
sizes or small schools with too many pupils enrolled. We want to give 
back to local authorities the legal powers they need to plan and provide 
enough school places in their local areas. The Government must ensure 
that the funding is available to deliver school places where needed. 
Local authorities should be at the centre of and responsible for the 
local democratic control of education. 

The national curriculum should be about the "what", but not "how", so 
that schools and teachers can teach in a way that best benefits the 
student. 

Schools should have the freedom to spend their budgets as they see fit 
and should be encouraged to invest in knowledgeable, enthusiastic and 
well qualified teachers.  

Schools must aim to educate, not to simply pass exams. The number of 
examinations that young people sit should be reduced, and schools should 
be judged on a broad range of indicators. The public ranking of schools 
by exam results should be discontinued. 

To minimise the impact of changes to grading criteria, and to ensure 
that exam results remain comparable in the long term, we will assess the 
effectiveness of a percentile based grading system.  

### Innovation

Our economy depends upon innovation. We need to make sure we have the 
right policies in place to support innovators in all sections of the 
economy. 

The UK has a very strong technology development and scientific research 
sector, however research funding is at a 20-year low of 0.5% of GDP. We 
would increase funding of research to at least 0.8% of GDP, matching the 
G8 average. 

That research investment must be open to all. For that reason we support 
open access to outputs of publicly funded scientific research.  We need
Research Councils UK (RCUK) to  continue its commitment to full open
access, provide grants to scholar-led open access journals and data 
archives.  It is also important that we can build on the work of others, 
patents exist to reward the inventors of truly outstanding ideas. We 
would reform the patent system to ensure it does just that, and prevent 
patents from being used to stifle competition. 

We will allow and encourage more competition in the manufacturing of 
patented devices by introducing a system of compulsory patent licensing, 
and we will provide exemptions to patent law for non-commercial use, 
personal study and academic research.
