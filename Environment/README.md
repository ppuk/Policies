Environment
===========

We need smart policy to improve our environment. The environmental 
challenges, from  dealing with local 'grotspots' to climate change, are 
monumental. We have a responsibility to look after our environment and 
wildlife. This requires changes in all parts of our economy and in our 
behaviour, but if we work together we can deal with both.  

If we want to be at the forefront of innovation in energy and get the 
most out of our resources and environment, we need to set and meet 
ambitious goals.  We know the UK can exceed the target of 80% reductions 
in emissions between 1990 and 2050.  

Litter is more than a blight on our landscape; it is an indication of 
wasted resources. We can work together to improve the areas where we 
live and at the same time deal with a threat to our world. Using new 
technologies for power generation and to fuel our cars will help a great 
deal too; we want to see investment in British engineering to bring 
about the changes and technology that we need.

There are simple solutions too, we support bringing in a bottle return 
scheme (paying for a deposit on bottles and cans which is given back 
when they are returned). This would reduce litter and the burden on 
recycling facilities, as well as changing attitudes towards our precious 
resources. Making polluters pay for the damage they do to our 
environment, whether they are big businesses or irresponsible landowners 
is the right thing to do.

Open spaces must be protected, land ownership must be transparent, our 
common heritage maintained and developers made to act responsibly. It is 
time for a fair environment policy.  There should be a new focus on 
littered and polluted "problem" areas, and a more proactive Environment 
Agency.

Power generation will be a major issue facing the UK in the coming 
decade. The next government will have to put together an effective and 
environmentally sound policy to ensure we have the required generation 
capacity. We believe that the focus should be on renewable energy as 
well as investigating and developing new technologies, including 
nuclear, and continuing to improve the effectiveness of existing ones.

Removing public subsidies to fossil fuel and hydrocarbon production and 
focusing support on renewable production would help to continue the UK's 
switch to cleaner, sustainable energy. We shouldn't just focus on large 
generators though, continuing the feed-in tariff would will ensure that 
small scale renewable power generation remains attractive.
