We are committed to an NHS that delivers a comprehensive, universal,
equitable, accessible service. It is vital that the NHS is publicly
funded and publicly accountable.

Since 2010 NHS funding per person has dropped in real terms. £800
million over the last government has been cut. This must be reversed if
we want a health service that is fit for purpose. We want to increase
NHS funding by 4% in real terms and bring UK healthcare spending in line
with the G7 average.  NHS funding must then continue to keep up with
need, rising with in line with UK population growth.  The NHS is a vital
service, it is right that it be funded by general taxation.

Privatisation, marketisation and private finance initiatives within the
NHS have increased inefficiencies and costs. Since 1997, NHS
infrastructure worth £11bn has been built under PFIs at a cost of £80bn,
diverting money that should have been spent on patients to investor
profits. These approaches create incentives to put profits over
patients. We are committed to reversing privatisation and preventing any
future PFI deals.

We want to see a more accessible NHS, one where patients are not put
off, or turned away due to charges. A key founding principle of the NHS
was access on the basis of need, not ability to pay, as such we must get
rid of NHS prescription fees in England (they have already been
eliminated in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland).

Funding for mental health services has been cut in real terms for three
years in a row, yet mental health problems account for 23% of the total
burden of disease. Despite the existence of cost-effective treatments it
receives only 13% of NHS health expenditure.

Mental health services must be funded appropriately to deal with demand
and tackle unmet needs. To achieve this, we would rebalance the NHS
budget to ensure mental health care receives the level of investment
needed to improve outcomes and we would ensure that primary care staff
are appropriately trained to deal with the mental health needs of their
patients.

NHS staff are a vital and precious resource and we have to make sure
they are able to do their jobs. It's vital that doctors, nurses and
other medical staff can focus on patient care; for this to happen they
must have the proper level of administrative and logistical support.

We aim to abolish patents on drugs and instead fund research directly,
allowing the NHS to reduce its outlay on costly medicines.

Health care has to work for everyone, as part of that we want to follow
the lead of countries like Norway that have comprehensive LGBT public
health plans with clear goals, and work to end the stigma around
HIV/AIDS and normalise HIV testing as a routine part of caring for our
health.

It is also wrong that we discriminate when it comes to giving blood.
Donations from men who have sex with men should be lifted. The focus
must be on individual screening and making sure as many people as
possible can donate blood and save lives.

The NHS deals with the negative consequences of alcohol and drug abuse
and as such should take the lead in both research and providing advice
in all areas of drug policy, from the medicinal use of marijuana to the
impact or dangers of new recreational drugs.
