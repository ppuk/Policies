Economy
=======

We need an economy that works for everyone. In the last 5 years the UK 
has seen cuts to services, a fall in wages and a cynical attack on the
support the state offers those in need.  We have seen publicly owned 
companies, including Royal Mail, the Fire Service College, and Remploy 
sold off for little gain to the taxpayer, but great returns for 
investors. UK debt is higher than it was in 2010. The deficit is higher 
than at any time until we bailed out the banks and unemployment is still 
at 4.7%. 

We can do better. We want to shore up government finances, and increase 
tax revenues while increasing pay at the lower end of the pay scale. A 
50% marginal rate of tax would be added for income over £500k per year.

Austerity is not going to repair the UK economy. We face a number of 
challenges, from a lack of social housing to poor transport and 
communications links that can be dealt with by initiating infrastructure 
projects. Infrastructure projects provide long-term benefit to the UK, 
stimulating current and future growth.

We would increase the rate of high speed broadband expansion, improve 
public transport (particularly outside London) and make Britain a world 
leader in renewable energy. This will allow us to reduce unemployment 
and provide skills to people who have lost jobs in other parts of the 
economy.

We must remove Intellectual Property laws that are hampering growth. 
It's time to stop the tide of over-reaching patents and trivial lawsuits 
that are tying up new ideas and killing off start-ups.

The 'too big to fail' culture that contributed to the economic crisis is 
still alive and well in the UK; we want to stop the UK taxpayer from 
propping-up incompetent or overstretched banks. There should be no more 
bank bailouts, and mechanisms must be put in place to deal with 
failures. To reduce reckless or questionable behaviour, directors of 
large public companies should have a personal liability for their 
actions and decisions. 

Taxation should be fair to the taxpayer; those earning least should pay 
a smaller amount of income tax, and should always have a lower marginal 
tax rate. That marginal tax rate should apply to all taxes on income, 
whether from employment, investments or other instruments. We would 
simplify the tax system to ensure that the tax system is as fair as 
possible. We want everyone to keep as much of the money that they earn 
as we can, but it must be the impact of taxation that is fair, not 
simply the amounts involved.

We would take action to reduce tax avoidance and act on tax evasion. A 
dedicated tax minister with clear responsibilities to us all would 
ensure all businesses and individuals are contributing, and that no 
group faces an excessive burden. Companies whose structures shift their 
tax burden abroad or into tax havens would be excluded from winning 
public sector contracts.

We support the implementation of a land value tax (LVT). LVT would raise 
more from the wealthiest without penalising the poor, whilst at the same 
time being much harder to dodge than income tax. It would support 
economic productivity, as those who rely on existing assets for income 
would be charged, whereas those who work for a living would not. 

Many industries that are essential to the United Kingdom (including 
water, electricity generation and supply, gas supply and other
utilities) have been privatised in recent decades, but continue to rely 
on massive government subsidy for infrastructure investment. These 
private organisations then take millions in support, whilst channelling 
profits to shareholders and directors. We believe that when taxpayers 
subsidise services, the taxpayer should see a return on their money 
before private investors are paid dividends. 

We would renationalise the Royal Mail and protect it from being damaged 
by cherry-picking private competitors. In  addition we propose that any 
government subsidy or grant to a  profit-making company for the delivery 
of services should be met pound-for-pound by private investment.
