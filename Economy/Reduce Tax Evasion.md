Reduce Tax Evasion
==================

To reduce tax evasion, we will aim to increase penalties for engaging in 
schemes aimed to evade tax unlawfully. The penalty for tax evasion 
should be sufficiently punitive that getting caught once outweighs the 
benefits of having engaged in evasion over a period of years.
