Free Software, Free Culture & Free Knowledge
============================================

### Free Software
Pirate Party UK supports the promotion of software that can be used, analysed,
disseminated and modified by anyone. Free/Libre Open Source Software is
essential for users' control of their own technical systems and provides
a significant contribution to strengthening the autonomy and privacy of
all users.

#### Mandatory use of free software in public administration

Pirate Party UK think citizens' data must be processed, managed and secured with
free software tools wherever possible. Proprietary software may only be
used as long as free software cannot effectively be used or created for
that specific purpose.

Free software reduces administrative costs, promotes local technical
support and increases the ability to identify malicious code. We will
drive the migration of the public sector to free software so that there
is no longer a dependency on specific suppliers.

### Free Culture
Free culture is an important resource for the education and creativity
of society. Pirate Party UK strives to promote artistic activity and cultural
diversity to ensure a rich educational and artistic environment for
current and future generations.

### Free Knowledge and Education
Pirate Party UK believes that the free flow of knowledge and information is
essential and must be promoted and guaranteed in education. Educational
institutions should increasingly use learning resources available under
free licenses where there are no restrictions on copying.

Technological progress creates new opportunities to share and develop
knowledge and learning concepts internationally. To capitalise on these
opportunities, we are committed to the development and support of free
and open educational materials.

The availability of educational media under free licenses to all is
essential for barrier-free access to education, both within and beyond
the borders of the EU.

Pirate Party UK sees innovation as the key to the development of our cultural 
and intellectual wealth. We support educating citizens and students about
their right to information and about free formats and software in all
types of educational facilities.

Pirate Party UK believes that publicly funded research should be freely
available to those that funded it. In this regard, we support the proposed
European Union initiative to provide open access as part of the Horizon 2020
research funding programme.

Pirate Party UK supports the digitisation and publication of documents stored in
public libraries and archives across the EU.

### Promotion of the Commons
Pirate Party UK will work towards adopting provisions in trade agreements which
support the use and development of open formats and Free/Libre Open
Source Software and promote the mutual recognition of licence models
like Creative Commons.
