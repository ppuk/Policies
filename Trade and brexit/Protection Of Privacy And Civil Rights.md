Protection Of Privacy And Civil Rights
======================================

# Data Protection and Surveillance
### Security in Freedom
The protection of civil liberties is a core principle of Pirate Party UK

The threat posed by unlawful and excessive surveillance measures,
imposed on us by governments both foreign and domestic, whether in
response to terrorism or other threats is grave. There is an immediate
need for action to redress the balance and restore our privacy.

### Ensure everyone's privacy
Europeans have a proud history of fighting for their fundamental rights
and the freedoms of their fellow citizens, and the UK is no exception.

Pirate Party UK accepts that there is a need for certain investigory powers to
aid in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. However, we believe that
the overreaching mass surveillance powers granted by the Investigatory Powers
Act 2016 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 before it actually
hinder the fight against crime by adding more hay to the haystack when it comes
to gathering intelligence.

To rectify this, we would roll back changes in data retention and data sharing
made by these laws and ensure that investigatory powers are used where needed
against targeted suspects with court approval and oversight. We would end the
unnecessary sharing of collected data between departments to better preserve
citizens privacy and security.

Adequate protection against crime is an important responsibility of the
state. We must ensure this responsibility is fulfilled through an
intelligent, rational and evidence-based security policy.

Pirate Party UK will demand strong data protection guarantees in any trade deals
with other countries, whether those trade deals are as part of EU Membership, or
our own following Brexit. We will push to maintain strong punishments for
organisations that mishandle private personal data, especially when that
mishandling results in a data breach where private information is exposed.

Pirate Party UK will reject the introduction of compulsory monitoring and
reporting devices, such as "smart meters".

Pirate Party UK will seek to enforce strict standards for any industrial systems
automatically processing personal or private information (such as access
control systems) essentially making those systems open source, publicly
documented and peer-reviewed, especially where those systems are used in
public-sector services.

# Systematic evaluation of existing surveillance powers and programs
### Prohibit mass surveillance
Public spaces are full of cameras that monitor the movement of people
and vehicles, track faces, and combine this information without
considering the potential for the erosion of privacy. The data shows
that the presence of such systems has little effect on the rate of crime
and that, at best, criminality simply shifts to other spaces. Pirate Party UK
supports and would prioritise the movement of police personnel from
monitoring duties, to patrolling the streets.

### Prohibition of electronic spying and collection of biometric data
Routine checks must not unreasonably interfere with privacy. We reject
the use of electronic "nude" scanners due their detrimental impact on
human dignity, the collection of communications content and metadata,
the perusal of private data on electronic devices and other similar
invasive procedures. We oppose the collection of biometric data from
innocent people and its storage in central databases.

### Fundamental rights "stamp" for new safety measures
Pirate Party UK would systematically examine all current and future security programmes in the UK. The
the approach of the security agencies of the UK must be reviewed on the
basis of evidence, to avoid adverse side effects and examine
alternatives and ensure compatibility with our fundamental rights.
We will create a  Human Rights Agency and ensure that the creation of a Human Rights Agency for Fundamental Rights has the
relevant powers to accomplish this task.


### Security Research and Monitoring Software
Pirate Party UK would seek to prevent the funding of research into technologies
that would be used to violate citizens' fundamental rights.

### Data Protection Regulation With a High Level of Data Protection
Data Protection Regulation should not lead to a lowering
of data protection standards, but must strengthen the rights of citizens.

Pirate Party UK considers that metadata created as a side effect of using any
technology system or service also be considered personal data. Users should be
able to request the type and content of any data given to third parties at any
time.

Personal data for data trade, advertising or market or opinion research must be
allowed only with the active and informed consent of the person concerned.

# Refugee policy
The UK approach to asylum and refugees must be based on the
acknowledgement of human rights and fully respect the Geneva Convention
on Refugees and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Pirate Party UK feels the UK needs to acknowledge at least some responsibility
for the ongoing refugee crisis, and be willing to offer a safe harbour to those
fleeing conflict in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. The UK should be
willing to accept more refugees, and without prejudice to their age, race or
gender. The UK should initiate programs to help those coming to the UK to
integrate into and participate in society rather than offloading them into
deprived areas to be ignored and targeted with abuse.
