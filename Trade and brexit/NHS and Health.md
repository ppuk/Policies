NHS and Health
=======
National Health Service (NHS) is not up for privatisation and will be a protected during the trade deals with countries and organisations outside of the United Kingdom. this includes all parts of the National Health Service included but not limited to GPs, A&E, Medical imaging intensive care and drug price control

the NHS is one of the UK's trousers and it would be a shame to ever lose it over a trade deal or dispute.
