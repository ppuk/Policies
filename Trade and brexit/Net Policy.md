Net Policy
==========
The digital revolution has changed social and economic structures
throughout world; free and equal access to the internet is now a basic
requirement for participation in civil society.

### Net Neutrality
Pirate Party UK would seek to defend network neutrality's place in trade deals
to ensure strong incentives for investment, fair competition and equal treatment
of everybody in the digital space.

Everyone must be able to have access to an Internet connection that does
not discriminate against any service or competitor. Traffic management
measures shall only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, operated in
a clear and transparent manner and only for technical reasons.

### Upgrading of Net Infrastructure
Pirate Party UK strongly supports the wide development of
state-of-the-art communications infrastructure. Our goal is to provide access to
broadband for everyone in the that we with directly trade. We would seek to end private monopolies over
the critical internet backbone structure making improved connectivity possible.
