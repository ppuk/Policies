### Brexit and Trade

The Pirate Party will commit to pushing for negotiations that protect existing
industries and without compromising our principles. The Pirate Party is wary
that on leaving the European Union, we may be susceptible to being pushed into
deals like ACTA by larger trading partners such as the US, which contain
policies like *Investor-state dispute settlement* (ISDS) agreements that could
jeopardise the independence and competitiveness of public-sector services.

### Brexit

We recognise the result of the 2016 Referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.
With a 52% share of the vote to Leave, it represents a clear desire to change
our relationship with the EU. However, the Pirate Party is unable to either
proceed with reverse it alone. As such, the Pirate Party would
support any outcome that ensures and safeguards our principles, such as the
protection of human rights, civil  and digital liberties,  knowledge sharing,
accountability and transparency of government, and evidence-based policy-making.
