Northern Ireland
=================
There are currently no solutions to another issue with the Northern Ireland border and we will work closely with them to the term and a solution suitable both for them and the European Union. We will continue to guarantee entry to the United Kingdom from Northern Ireland with two passports and without checks as the Treaty between us and guarantees.
