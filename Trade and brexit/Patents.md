Patents

### Patents in the Information Age
Patents mostly function as a deterrent to innovation rather than as an
incentive. The patenting of knowledge in areas like genetics and
biotechnology, as well as software, renders it a tangible threat to the
future of our society.

Monopolies on plants and seeds and costly legal disputes about often
trivial patents already demonstrate how it is both innovators and
consumers who have to pay the price. Patent law needs to be reformed or
replaced with an approach that enables freer and fairer markets instead
of continuing to further stifle innovation.

### Rebalancing Patents with the Common Good
Pirate Party UK believes that patents do not exist to allow big businesses to
stifle competition with an ever-growing tide of trivial and overreaching
patents. We would require patents to demonstrate the need for protection, by
demonstrating that a new innovation could not be trivially replicated,
and that getting the innovation to market as a viable product would be
impossible without protection.

### Patents in the Information Society
Economic success in the information society is no longer just dependent
on technological inventions, but on the development of knowledge and
sharing of information. The current patent system allows large corporations to
significantly hamper technological innovation with the rampant granting of
trivial patents.

Patents should never be granted for "inventions" that are trivial,
non-substantial, computer programs, business models or works of nature.
These types of patent impede the development of an information society
and result in the privatisation of the commons. Small and medium IT
companies throughout Europe prove that patents on software are no
prerequisite to economic success. Innovation must be fairly rewarded,
but this does not necessarily require the granting of monopolistic
privileges that stifle innovation and negatively affect the access to
essential goods.

The EU, its member states, the UK, and other industrialised countries should not
force less developed countries to accept patent provisions that are
likely to be detrimental to their essential needs, health, education or
development opportunities.

### Patents, Medicines and Health
Pirate Party UK opposes the frequent abuses of patent privileges, such as
introducing spurious changes to medicines with expiring patent
protection. Uncompetitive practices such as paying competitors in order
to delay the marketing of generics should be actively prevented.

We support the establishment and funding of alternative methods to
incentivise pharmaceutical innovation, to progressively replace patents
in this area. It is our aim to break the direct link between the reward
for advances and the price of the end product to ensure medicines are
affordable for all.

Universities and research institutes should be able to carry out
scientific research for health and medicine without being encumbered by
patents.

### International Regulation of Intellectual Monopolies
Pirate Party UK will strive for a revision of the TRIPS Agreement in favour of
restricting exclusive rights on intangible goods. We would aim for
similar restrictions to apply to all trade agreements which may include
similar or even more far-reaching regulations on patents and copyright.
