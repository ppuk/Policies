Renationalise The Royal Mail
============================

Royal Mail's universal service obligation has been damaged by 
unsustainable competition. The universal service is a natural monopoly, 
and best delivered by a public company. We would renationalise the Royal 
Mail and protect it from being damaged by cherry-picking competitors.
