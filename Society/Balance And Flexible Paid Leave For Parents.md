Balance And Flexible Paid Leave For Parents
===========================================

Many new fathers are not allowed to take annual leave alongside 
paternity leave. This gives couples very limited flexibility to arrange 
their leave to suit their family. The Shared Parental Leave scheme used 
in Northern Ireland would be made UK-wide.

This means the UK should introduce balanced and flexible parental leave, 
to be available to both partners. We would propose a system where both 
the mother and father of a child each have a minimum amount of time off 
'banked' and then an additional allocation to be divided between them, 
obviously this includes LGBT people too.
