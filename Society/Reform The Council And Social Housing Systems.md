Reform The Council And Social Housing Systems
=============================================

We want to see affordable housing for all. We would enable councils to 
build affordable council housing. The Right to Buy council houses would 
be removed. Any Income from council housing sales would be ringfenced 
for housing construction. Councils would also be permitted to borrow to 
fund housing construction.
