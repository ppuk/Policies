A Rational Points Based Immigration System
==========================================

The demand for certain skills that are in short supply in the UK has 
made immigration vitally important for both the public and the private 
sector. Well-managed and well-controlled immigration is important to 
ensure that the UK remains competitive and innovative. We will therefore 
ensure that immigration is well managed by ensuring that record keeping 
related to entry into and departure from the UK is suitable. Without 
detailed information about the flow of people into and out of the 
country it will become difficult to ensure that the areas where 
immigrants are settling are able to cope with both changes in the level 
of demand and changes in demographics.

Immigration applications should be considered not only on the basis of 
what skills an immigrant brings to his sponsor and whether an applicant 
is able to support themselves without any recourse to public funds, but 
also where the applicant is intending to live and work.
