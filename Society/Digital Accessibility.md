Digital Accessibility
=====================

We will promote the inclusion of accessibility features, such as 
subtitles and audio descriptions for the disabled. Our aim is to make 
content accessible for disabled people.

We will introduce an obligation for publishers to provide a DRM-free 
copy of their product where necessary to allow the use of accessibility 
programs (for example, voice synthesiser software to "read out" an 
e-book to a visually impaired person).
