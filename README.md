How we decide on our Direction
==============================


### Principles
The Pirate Party in the UK adopted a set of seven principles on which 
its policies are based. All the policies and ideas you see here, as 
well as the stances we take in our advocacy, local or national 
campaigning, come from these seven principles. They determine whether 
we can or cannot support a specific initiative and they should be 
sufficient to determine our position on any number of issues, whether 
outlined in our manifesto or additional policy documents or not:

* Our society is built upon the sharing of knowledge, ideas and culture.
It is furthered by freedom of thought and expression, and protected by 
the rule of law. The Pirate Party exists to ensure the preservation and 
development of these foundations.

* All are equal under the law. We all have a say in the structure and 
processes of governance and the right to know what is done on our 
behalf.

* To endure the security of our society it is the responsibility of the 
government to provide for its defence, the mechanisms of justice and 
such services and in infrastructure required to meet its needs.

* To be free to participate in society everyone must have access to 
justice, education and such services and in infrastructure required for 
life within it.

* We will act on the basis of evidence, with the consent of society 
through democracy, in the interests of all.

* Human Dignity is inviolable. Each of us has a right to life and to 
live, to freedom of thought and self determination, and to participate
in society.

* Respect for our private and family life by government and society is 
fundamental and we all have freedom of choice in our associations and
relationships.

Democracy is in crisis in the United Kingdom. Whether it is online or on
the doorstep, people are telling us that they feel alienated, ignored, 
that they have given up voting as it changes nothing.

It's this sense of powerlessness over the forces that shape our lives 
and the space around us that is so worrying in the UK today. Creeping 
privatisation means all aspects of our society are being divided up and 
parcelled out. It can be impossible to find out who is responsible for 
the most basic aspects of our environment, public spaces and services, 
let alone get anyone to do anything about it.

We are constantly under surveillance, whether it is by Europe's biggest 
army of CCTV cameras or by companies like ATOS checking up on us. In a 
country of physical barriers, many find the online world a place to 
reclaim some freedom. But here too we are increasingly to be watched and 
restricted, while government and courts gather powers to disconnect us, 
block websites and monitor what we say and do.

At the heart of Pirate Party politics is the right for everyone to share 
knowledge and take an equal part in society. That is the way to take 
control over the world around us. That is what we are setting out here.

This document is the result of the input and debate of thousands of 
people. It's the UK's first crowd-sourced manifesto. We've always 
believed in a politics that is done with people not to people, this is 
what we have delivered here. The process has been exciting not just 
because it has been unique in British politics, but also because it has 
resulted in a manifesto that really does offer a chance to break the 
cycle of alienation and powerlessness.

The Pirate Party Develops Policy in a collaborative manner, allowing 
anyone to have input and ultimately allowing its members to make the 
decision as to what the party stands for. The policies you find on 
these pages are the result of a process that allows us to refine and 
continually assess our positions, a process that we would encourage you 
to take part in.

The result is a broad range of principles, that our candidates will be 
proud to stand on.
