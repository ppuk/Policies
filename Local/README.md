Local
=====

Our local policies apply to County Council or Town Council levels.

We want our libraries to remain a free source of knowledge and 
information but also to do so much more in a passive, user-friendly 
way. Our security and anonymity should be protected when using a public 
machine and we should look to lessen the risk of using public internet 
connections.

Councils should be the frontier in what open source, production-ready 
software can be used to save the public purse some money and increase 
the circulation of open alternatives.

The communication between councils and the residents needs improvements 
across the UK. While some consultations have a sensible layout,
others are completely different. They can range from a simple survey in one town 
while in others a full written response is necessary. Online 
consultations in a standard format will remedy this.

Councils should be expected to be completely open and transparent, 
lessening the need for FOI requests but should a FOI request be 
required, they should be easily accessible.
