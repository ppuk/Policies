Create a Formal Notion of Pseudo-Public Space
============================================

There's very little genuinely public space in the UK, whether you are 
looking for it online or offline. Conversely, there are many places that are 
private and yet modern life strongly encourages you into them, such as shopping 
centres, walkways, parks and open spaces around churches, and other 
buildings.

These spaces have become so important to people that it is time to 
recognise that citizens have rights in them, despite their technically being 
private spaces.

The Pirate Party intends to define a legal notion of "pseudo-public 
space" which is space that, while privately owned, has become so woven 
into the lives of citizens, and so essential to their daily routines, 
that any rights that they might enjoy in a public place also apply.
