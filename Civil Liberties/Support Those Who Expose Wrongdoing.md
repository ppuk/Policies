Support Those Who Expose Wrongdoing
===================================

The Pirate Party has shown its commitment to whistleblowers by being the
only party to actively and consistently support activism of this nature.

We will stand up for the rights of any whistleblower. We recognise the value of 
whistleblowers to society and we will defend the right of citizens to 
expose illegal practices in the workplace and elsewhere. We will 
introduce stronger protections for whistleblowers. Exposing corrupt or 
illegal activities must take precedence over contract law and copyright
law, and no-one should fear persecution for making the public aware of a
breach of the law.
